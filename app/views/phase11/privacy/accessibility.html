  <p class="govuk-body">The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No.2) Accessibility Regulations 2018. </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">This website is fully compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA</a> standard</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Non accessible content</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>
  
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non compliance with the accessibility</h2>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Accessibility problems</li>
    <li>Which of the WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria the problem fails on</li>
    <li>When you plan to fix the problem.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">[E.g. Some images do not have a text alternative, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content). We plan to add text alternatives for all images by September 2020. When we publish new content we’ll make sure our use of images meets accessibility standards.]</p>
  
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Disproportionate burden</h2>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Accessibility problems you’re claiming would be a disproportionate burden to fix</li>
    <li>Which of the WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria the problem fails on</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Navigation and accessing information</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">[E.g. There’s no way to skip the repeated content in the page header (for example, a ‘skip to main content’ option). This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.1 (bypass blocks).</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">OR</p>
  <p class="govuk-body"> It’s not always possible to change the device orientation from horizontal to vertical without making it more difficult to view the content. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.4 (orientation).</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">OR</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">It’s not possible for users to change text size without some of the content overlapping. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.4 (resize text)</p>

  
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Interactive tools and transactions</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">[E.g. Some of our interactive forms are difficult to navigate using a keyboard. For example, because some forms controls are missing a ‘label’ tag. </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Our forms are built and hosted through third party software and ‘skinned’ to look like our website. </p> -->
